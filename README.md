The ServiceNow CLI is a command-line interface that lets you perform instance operations from your local system. You can extend the CLI to include new commands that meet your application's needs.

Benefits
The ServiceNow CLI lets you:
- Perform basic CRUD operations on records in your instance.
- Develop custom components and deploy them to your instance to personalize a UI.
- Create custom commands that enable you to manage custom applications from the command line.
- Use the ServiceNow CLI in scripts to simplify setup tasks and operational activities.
